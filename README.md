# AWS EC2 Operations with gRPC

## Overview

This repository showcases my experience with AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Simple Storage Service (S3), and the gRPC framework. The project demonstrates building a gRPC server deployed on an EC2 instance, integrating AWS operations and API development concepts.

## Objectives

Through this project, I achieved several important learning outcomes:

- **EC2 Operations:** I gained expertise in launching and managing AWS EC2 instances, configuring them for web applications, and effective instance management.

- **S3 Interaction:** I learned to work with AWS Simple Storage Service (S3), create buckets, and programmatically interact with S3 using libraries like boto3.

- **gRPC Implementation:** Building a gRPC server and client enhanced my knowledge of the gRPC framework and its integration with Protocol Buffers serialization.

- **API Development:** Developing the gRPC service improved my API development skills, focusing on defining service methods, messages, and endpoints using Protocol Buffers.

## Project Workflow

To complete the project, I followed these main steps:

1. **Proto File Definition:** Created a .proto file outlining the gRPC service structure, including server and client specifications.

2. **Code Compilation:** Compiled the .proto file with language-specific commands, generating code for server-client communication.

3. **Server Implementation:** Developed a server file to implement the gRPC service, exposing API endpoints to clients.

4. **Client Implementation:** Created a client file using the generated code to interact with the gRPC server's API.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally or deploy it on AWS, I followed these steps:

1. **AWS Setup:** Configured AWS credentials and the environment for AWS service interactions.

2. **Repository Setup:** Cloned this repository to my local machine.

3. **Dependency Installation:** Installed necessary dependencies according to my chosen programming language.

4. **Proto File Compilation:** Compiled the .proto file using appropriate commands to generate required gRPC code.

5. **Server Deployment:** Deployed the gRPC server on an EC2 instance.

6. **Client Execution:** Executed the client code to interact with the deployed gRPC server, simulating AWS EC2 and S3 operations.

## Usage

Project usage involves the following steps:

1. **Server Launch:** Started the gRPC server on an EC2 instance.

2. **Client Interaction:** Ran the client code to initiate interactions with the gRPC server.

3. **Exploration:** Explored and observed the simulation of AWS EC2 and S3 operations through client-server communication.

## Takeaways

Completing this project significantly expanded my knowledge and skills in several areas:

- **AWS Proficiency:** Gained confidence in working with AWS services like EC2 and S3, encompassing instance management and storage.

- **gRPC Mastery:** Deepened understanding of the gRPC framework and its seamless integration with Protocol Buffers.

- **API Development Expertise:** Enhanced ability to design and implement APIs, emphasizing structured data serialization.
